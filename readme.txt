BASIC NODE JS ROUTING
1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. Inside the project folder, create a file named app.js.
3. In app.js, set up a basic web server using Node.js and the http module. The server should listen on port 3000.
4. Extend the server to handle different routes. For example, create routes for the home page response (/), an about page response (/about), and a contact page response(/contact).
5. Create a 404 response: Instead of a simple "Page Not Found" text, create a separate 404 page and display it when a route is not found.
