Express.js Product Management App
------------------

This is a simple Express.js application for managing products, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete product records. This readme provides instructions on how to set up and use the application.

Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```
   cd <name of directory>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

Usage:
1. Start the Express.js server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will be running at http://localhost:3030/. You can access the following routes:

   - GET /products
     Retrieve a list of all products.

   - GET /products/:id
     Retrieve a specific product by its ID.

   - POST /products
     Create a new product by sending a POST request with a JSON body containing product details (name, price, description).

   - PUT /products/:id
     Update an existing product by sending a PUT request with a JSON body containing updated product details.

   - DELETE /products/:id
     Delete an existing product by sending a DELETE request with the product's ID.

3. All products are stored in a JSON file named 'products.json'. You can view and edit this file to manage the product data.

4. When creating a new product, the server automatically assigns an ID to the product in ascending order.

5. The application provides error handling for various scenarios, such as product not found, internal server errors, and more.
